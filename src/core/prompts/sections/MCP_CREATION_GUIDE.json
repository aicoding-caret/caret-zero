	"important_considerations": [
		"MCP servers are non-interactive (no OAuth flows, browser windows, user prompts runtime).",
		"Provide credentials/tokens upfront via env vars in MCP settings. For OAuth, may need setup script (e.g., get-refresh-token.js) for refresh token."
	],
	"editing_mcp_servers": "User might request adding tools/resources to existing MCP server ({{mcp_connected_server_names}}), e.g., for same API. Possible if repo path found in server args. Use list_files/read_file to explore, replace_in_file to edit. If server runs from installed package, creating new server might be better.",
	"mcp_servers_are_not_always_necessary": "User may not always request MCP servers. Tasks might be solvable with existing tools. MCP SDK extends capabilities but is specialized. Implement MCP servers only on explicit user request (e.g., \"add a tool that...\"). This guide helps understand/work with MCP servers when needed. You have tools for many tasks."
